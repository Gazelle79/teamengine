# Installation

## Quick install

The `teamengine-virtualization` module enables the automatic creation of a fully provisioned server 
image that can be deployed and run on a dynamic infrastructure platform such as [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) 
and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). See the [Virtualization Guide](./virt-guide.html) for 
instructions.

The [TEAM Engine Builder project](https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine-builder) provides 
another way to build TEAM Engine and selected OGC test suites on a physical or virtual machine. Shell 
scripts for Windows and Unix-like systems are available. Detailed instructions are provided in the 
tutorial.


## Download and build from source

### Prerequisites

- **Java 8**: Download the Java JDK (Java Development Kit) 8, from <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html>.
- **Apache Maven**: Download the latest release from <https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi>.
- **Git**: Download the Git version control system (version 1.8 or newer) from <https://git-scm.com/download/>
- **Apache Tomcat 7**: TEAM Engine has been tested with Tomcat 7.0; the latest release is available 
from <http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi>.

### Get the source code 

The source code is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine). 
Use Git to clone the repository and checkout a branch or a tagged release as indicated below:

    git clone https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine.git
    git checkout ${project.version}

[Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) 3.2.5 or later is required to build the teamengine 
code base, which currently consists of the following modules:

- **teamengine-core**: Main CTL script processor
- **teamengine-resources**: Includes shared resources such as stylesheets
  and schemas
- **teamengine-spi**: Provides an extensibility framework and a REST-like
  API for test execution
- **teamengine-spi-ctl**: Enables the execution of legacy CTL test suites using a RESTful API.
- **teamengine-realm**: A custom Tomcat user realm for file-based authentication
- **teamengine-web**: A web application for executing test suites and
  browsing test results
- **teamengine-console**: A console application that provides a command-line interface 
  for executing test suites in Unix and Windows environments.
- **teamengine-virtualization**: Enables the automatic creation of virtualization 
  images using [Packer](https://www.packer.io/).

  
### Build with Maven

Simply run `mvn package` in the root project directory to generate all
build artifacts, or run `mvn install` to also install them into the local
Maven repository. The main build artifacts are listed below.

- **teamengine-console-\${project.version}-bin.[zip|tar.gz]**: Archive containing the console application (command-line usage)
- **teamengine-console-\${project.version}-base.[zip|tar.gz]**: Archive containing the initial contents of the teamengine instance
    directory (TE\_BASE)
- **teamengine.war**: The JEE (Servlet) web application
- **teamengine-common-libs.[zip|tar.gz]**: Archive containing common runtime dependencies (e.g. JAX-RS 1.1,
    Apache Derby)

The site documentation can be generated by simply executing the 'mvn site' phase 
against the top-level POM. An aggregrate PDF document is also created and placed 
in the target/pdf directory.


### Set up an instance directory (TE_BASE)

The value of the `TE_BASE` system property or environment variable specifies the 
location of the instance directory that contains several essential sub-directories. 
Create the TE_BASE directory (e.g. at /srv/teamengine) and unpack the contents of 
the teamengine-console-\${project.version}-base archive into this location; make 
sure that users (including the Tomcat user) have write access. The structure of 
the TE\_BASE directory is shown below.

    TE_BASE
      |-- config.xml    # main configuration file
      |-- resources/    # test suite resources
          |-- site      # site-specific HTML (welcome, title, etc.)
          |-- lib       # Java-based test suites and supporting libraries
      |-- scripts/      # CTL test scripts
      |-- work/         # teamengine work directory
      +-- users/
         |-- {user1}/   # user account information and test run results
         |-- {user2}/
         +-- ...

CTL test scripts must be placed in the TE_BASE/scripts directory. Java-based test 
suites along with their supporting libraries are placed in the TE_BASE/resources/lib 
directory.

### Deploy the web application

#### System requirements

-   Java runtime: Oracle JDK 8 - [latest JDK
    release](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/)
-   Servlet container: Apache Tomcat 7.0 - [latest Tomcat
    release](http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi)

#### Create a dedicated Tomcat instance

Apache Tomcat 7.0 is a supported servlet container. It is **strongly**
recommended that a dedicated Tomcat instance be created to host the
teamengine application. That is, keep the location of the instance-specific
data--referred to as `CATALINA_BASE` in the Tomcat documentation--separate 
from the Tomcat software installation (CATALINA_HOME). Create it as outlined 
below for your operating system.

To create a CATALINA_BASE directory in Windows:

    mkdir base-1 & cd base-1
    xcopy %CATALINA_HOME%\conf conf\
    mkdir lib logs temp webapps work

In a Unix-like environment:

    sudo mkdir -p /srv/tomcat/base-1; cd /srv/tomcat/base-1
    sudo cp -r $CATALINA_HOME/conf .
    sudo mkdir lib logs temp webapps work

The recommended JVM options for the Tomcat instance are shown below.
Note that the maximum memory heap size (`-Xmx`) may need to be increased
as the number of concurrent users increases.

`CATALINA_OPTS="-server -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m -DTE_BASE=$TE_BASE -Dderby.system.home=$DERBY_DATA"`

Unpack the contents of the teamengine-common-libs archive into the
CATALINA_BASE/lib directory. Deploy the `teamengine.war` component by
either copying it into the CATALINA_BASE/webapps directory or using the
Tomcat *Manager* application. Start the Tomcat instance.

The URIs listed below provide starting points for discovering and executing 
test suites. Modify the path if the name of the WAR file (and hence the context 
path) has been changed from the default value: "teamengine".

* `/teamengine`: Home page for selecting and running test suites using the web interface
* `/teamengine/rest/suites`: Presents a listing of available test suites that expose 
a RESTful API, with links to test suite documentation


### Install test suites in TEAM Engine

There are various examples of an executable test suite (ETS) that can be installed in 
TEAM Engine. For example,

- [GML 3.2.1](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-gml32)
- [WMS 1.3](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-wms13)

Even though the GML suite is a Java-based implementation that uses TestNG and the WMS 1.3 
suite uses OGC CTL scripts, they both follow Maven conventions; the suites are built and 
deployed in a similar manner. To download and install a test suite do the following steps:

1. Checkout the test suite: e.g. `git clone  https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-gml32.git`
2. Change to the project directory `cd ets-gml32`
3. Checkout a specific release version (run the `git tag` command to list these) e.g. for GML, `git checkout 1.25`
4. Build the test suite: `mvn clean install`
5. Check that the build is successful--you should see **BUILD SUCCESS** displayed in the terminal output
6. Change to the target folder `cd target`
7. Unpack the archive file that ends with *ctl.zip* into `$TE_BASE/scripts`
8. If it exists, unpack the archive file that ends with *deps.zip* into `$TE_BASE/resources/lib`


### Customize the welcome page

Several elements of the welcome page may be customized if desired: the logo in the header, 
the main text, and the content in the footer. The files located in the TE_BASE/resources/site 
directory can be modified to provide site-specific content:


- **site/logo.png**: The logo that appears in the header (at top left). The size of the default image is 127x58 px.
- **site/welcome.txt**: The main text.
- **site/footer.txt**: Footer content.
- **site/title.html**: Title of the web application
